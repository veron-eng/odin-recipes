    <p>Lasagne is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,
        made of very wide, flat sheets. Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of 
        stacked layers of lasagne alternating with fillings such as rag√π (ground meats and tomato sauce), vegetables, cheeses
        (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan), and seasonings and spices, like Italian seasoning, such as garlic, 
        oregano and basil. The dish may be topped with grated cheese, which becomes melted after baking. Typically cooked pasta is 
        assembled with the other ingredients and then baked in an oven. The resulting baked pasta is cut into single-serving square portions.</p>



        <h2>ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced</li>
            <li>1/2cup diced carrot</li>
            <li>1/2 cup diced celery</li>
            <li> cup diced yellow onion</li>
        </ul>
    
        <ol>
            <li>Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a </li>
            <li>Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool.</li>
            <li>Drain spinach in a mesh strainer set over a bowl, pressing it down with a fork to squeeze out as much water and possible; reserve the liquid. Puree spinach in a blender until smooth.</li>
